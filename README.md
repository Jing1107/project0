## Tic tac toe

### About the Project
Here is the live demo []
https://jing1107.github.io/project0/ []
for the live site.



#### This is the first game I've ever programmed. The below skills were tested.

- Command line
- Source control
- Deployment
- It's a simple two player game of TicTacToe built with HTML, CSS, Javascript and the jQuery library.

The basic requirement is to have the game switch turns between X and 0 and visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row or a draw is found.


### Bonus functionality:
- [x] Animations including an looping gradient background

- [x] Fade in and fade out of player icons

- [x] Modal displaying which player has won and a restart button

### Future improvements:
Review code and make it DRYer

Ability for players to customise their tokens

Adding AI version for only one player

Automation of reset once the game has finished
