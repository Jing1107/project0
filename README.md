for the live site.

This is the first game I've ever programmed. The below skills were tested.

Command line
Source control
Deployment
It's a simple two player game of TicTacToe built with HTML, CSS, Javascript and the jQuery library.

The basic requirement is to have the game switch turns between X and 0 and visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row or a draw is found.

Bonus functionality:

Animations including an looping gradient background
Fade in and fade out of player icons
Modal displaying which player has won and a restart button
Future improvements:

Review code and make it DRYer
LocalStorage
Ability for players to customise their tokens
